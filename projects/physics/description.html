<p>This is the first custom engine I ever attempted to make. I tried a lot of stuff out, but most of it never went
	anywhere. It has the start of a job-oriented ECS system, but it was unfinished. There are no textures or sounds. It
	uses GLFW to manage the window and HID input and Dear ImGUI for the UI. It rendered using OpenGL and GLAD. In my
	subsequent engines I would mostly use the Win32 API instead of
	third party libraries.</p>

<p>The physics part was the main focus. The physics engine was entirely custom. Convex meshes would be generated using
	quickhull, then an optimized Seperating Axis Test would be used for collision detection. There was no broadphase. It
	used a few techniques in collision resolution such as persistent contact points.

	<li>Date: 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Kind of an ECS based, cache-friendly memory management system</li>
	<li>GLTF mesh loading</li>
	<li>Console/binding based input system</li>
	<li>Rigidbody physics</li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No sound or textures</li>
	<li>No inertia tensor calculation (I couldn't figure it out at the time)</li>
	<li>I'll bet there are lots of issues with the entity system, it was never really tested</li>
</ul>

<p>I attempted to make a grid-based map editor, but only got as far as creating boxes, saving and loading, and compiling
	into a binary format.</p>
